Even before you've crossed the border into Frost Reach, you can feel the chill. It sweeps down from the distant mountains to greet you, carrying with it a hissing wind that plucks at your scarf to allow the frigid drizzle its malevolent egress. Some primal recess of your brain urges you to turn around before it's too late. This is the point of no return.
[question=border]You hitch up your travelling bag as you approach the border checkpoint. It is a small, cozy cabin-type structure with a slanted roof much in need of repair, groaning under a heavy snowdrift. Lantern light flickers in the windows, and smoke curls from a crooked chimney.
[choice]Approach the checkpoint.
As you near the building, two guardsmen step out and signal you to halt. They wear dark grey uniform jackets with broad leather belts and arming swords. One of them-- taller, and with red shoulder patches denoting a sergeant's rank-- hails you.
"Hold, traveler. Got some procedures to follow, 'n we'll get you through quick-like."
You nod your assent and place your satchel on the ground. The shorter guard hoists it onto a small table and begins wrestling with the buckles, swearing under his breath, while the sergeant steps closer to squint at you.
[question=from]"Where've you come from?" he asks, assessing your traveling garb with an appraising eye.
[choice]Eld Ombyr.
[choice]Warm Front.
[choice]Ghyde Light.

The shorter guard finishes his cursory inspection of the contents of your bag and returns it to you. "Got any weapons on your person?" he inquires.
"No," you respond truthfully.
The guard presses on. "Are you in possession of any magickal artefacts or substances?"
"No," you lie.
[question=boilsCheck]"Right, then," the sergeant says. "If you could remove your hood and scarf, please. Boils check. I understand you're probably freezing already, southerner, so we'll make this quick, just a precaution. Can't have any flaks staggering over the border, now can we?"
[choice]There's no need for that.
"That won't be necessary," you say quickly, reaching inside your coat and producing your grandfather's letter. You hold it out in clear view of the sergeant.
"I'm afraid it's not--" The sergeant's disapproving frown fades to slack-jawed disbelief as he catches sight of the red wax seal on the letter. More particularly, the insignia it bears: the image of a skull with a keyhole in the center of its forehead.
The other guard looks on in confusion."What is it, sir?"
[question=inOrder]"Nothing, nothing." The sergeant shooes the letter back inside your pocket as if it's coated with the Bloody Boils itself. "Everything's in order. Go on through, traveller, and welcome to Frost Reach."
[choice]Cross the border and proceed north.
Past the checkpoint, you proceed on foot to the small town where you are to rendezvous with your guide. Even in a village such as this, the architecture is already distinctive from the south; each building's roof is slanted at acute angles to minimalize snow accumulation. Most lodgings are quite small, claustrophobic even, to conserve the furnace-heat.
Wiping the sleet from your face, you duck inside the travelers' hostel and look around. The place is nearly empty, and to your relief you are able to locate your guide almost immediately. He is wearing a bright red scarf, as instructed. Catching his attention with an awkward wave, you pull up a rickety chair and seat yourself at the small table where he nurses a steaming mug.
The man introduces himself as Vogel, and as he pulls down his scarf to talk you get a good look at him. He is nt exactly a handsome fellow-- hooded eyes, beer-stained beard, bushy brows nearing collision, and a grimace full of rotten teeth. His nose and ears have been badly scarred by frostbite. He is fairly young-- late twenties, early thirties-- but a hard life has worn on him.
"Show me," he croaks hoarsely.
You produce the letter once again. Vogel reaches for it, and out of reflex you pull it back. Noting your caution, Vogel scoffs sardonically.
"Whatever Assemblyman Eisenbrand wants with you, I don't know and I don't want to know," he says. It's always strange to hear your grandfather referred to by his title. You sheepishly tilt the letter so Vogel can see the red wax seal and the skull.
[question=gender]Vogel nods, satisfied. "All I need. You're just a package, friend. Hells, you're so bundled up I couldn't say whether you're man, woman, or flak."
[choice]I'm a man.
[choice]I'm a woman.
[choice]It doesn't matter.
"Hrm." The guide takes a swig of his pungent drink, setting it down with a decisive <i>clunk</i> and a growling belch. ChoiceDependent
Vogel unfolds a small, faded map onto the tabletop. "Here's how this is going to work. A few hours north of here is Fimbulstadt. That's the nearest station we can catch the Chain. From there we'll take the line straight through to Northstar, and then all the way up to Utgard." He coughs wetly. "That's as far as the Chain'll take us. Final leg is overland to <i>you-know-where</i>."
You ask him a few more questions about the logistics and timetable of the journey, and he answers to your satisfaction. With matters settled, the two of you leave the hostel and hurry north toward Fimbulstadt. Time is of the essence; you know that even more keenly than Vogel does.
Fimbulstadt is more impressive than the border town, but not by much. The roads are well-cobbled, at least, and you pass several workers shoveling snow to keep the lanes clear. Northerners are certainly a hardy people, you observe. When you catch a few townsfolk squinting suspiciously at you, you are reminded that they are generally distrustful of outsiders as well.
